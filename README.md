## Technical overview
Describe how your skill works for anyone who may need to come in and maintain or add to it. Example; Hooks into `did-enter` and sends a `message` to a `teammate`.

### Services
 * `vip` - Tells us who to send to.

### Utilities
 * `rewards` - Does something else.

### Custom events
Describe any custom events your skill emits. Make sure you include whether or not it honors `preventDefault` and include the `payload`'s schema.

#### `vip-alerts:will-send`

[
    {
        teammateId: UUID4, // teammate receiving the alert
        body: String // the message
    },
    {
        teammateId: UUID4, // teammate receiving the alert
        body: String // the message
    }
]
```

#### `my-slug:custom-event`
This is just a placeholder for now, put in yours! Honors `preventDefault`.

**Payload**
```js
{
    hello: 'world'
}
