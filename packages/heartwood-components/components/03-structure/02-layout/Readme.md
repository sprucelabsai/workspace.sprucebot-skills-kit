# Layout

The Layout element is simply a wrapper element used to provide proper spacing to nested Layout Sections.

Use a Layout element whenever you need to provide horizontal padding and vertical spacing to sections of a page or to divide content into multiple columns.

# Layout Section

Layout Section creates spacing between sections of content within a layout.

Use a Layout Section element to divide content within a Layout into separate vertical sections or horizontal columns.
By default, each Layout Section will fill the entire width of its parent.

Secondary Layout Sections can be used to create multi-column layouts.

Combining a Primary Layout Section and a Secondary Layout Section will create a multi-column layout with a larger primary width column and smaller secondary width column.
