# Card
Cards bundle together content, and related links and actions.

## Guidelines:
- Every card should solve a problem for the user
- Cards should communicate their own level of priority
- Card states must be persistent
- Cards should be concise and relevant to the user
- Important actions should be represented as buttons in the card footer
- Less important actions may be included in the header; a single [Simple Button](/components/detail/simple-button) may be used, or a Context Menu if there are many actions
