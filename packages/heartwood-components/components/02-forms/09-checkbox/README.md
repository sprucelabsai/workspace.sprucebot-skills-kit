# Checkbox
Checkboxes represent multiple options of which one, many, or none may be selected. Checkboxes may also be used to indicated nested selections, such as categories and their respective services.

## When to use:
Use Checkboxes when a user may select one, many, or none of the options in a relatively small set.

## When not to use:
- When only one option may be selected; instead use a [Radio](/components/detail/radio)
- When there are many options; TBD â€” use some variation of an [Autosuggest](/components/detail/autosuggest)
