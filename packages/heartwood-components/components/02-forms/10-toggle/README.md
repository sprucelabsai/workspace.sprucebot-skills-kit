# Toggle
A Toggle allows the user to enable or disable a feature synchronously.

## When to use:
Use a toggle for changes that donâ€™t require review, and for settings that are independent from one another.

## When not to use:
- For interdependent, multiple choices, or nested options; instead use a [Checkbox](/components/detail/checkbox)
- For changes that a user may need to review; instead use other forms of input with a submit handler.
