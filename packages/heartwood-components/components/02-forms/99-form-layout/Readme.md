# Form Layout

The Form Layout element is a wrapper element for Form Layout Item and Form Layout Group elements. The tight spacing variant can be used for forms where vertical space is a concern.

When building a form, the Form Layout element should wrap form content to provide propper spacing for Form Layout Item and Form Layout Group elements.

# Form Layout Item

The Form Layout Item element provides vertical spacing for form elements.

# Form Layout Group

The Form Layout Group element wraps Form Layout Items that should be displayed in horizontal columns. The condensed variant can be used to provide a more condensed column width for more tightly spaced Form Layout Item elements.
