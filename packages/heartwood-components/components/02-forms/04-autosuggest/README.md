# Autosuggest

An Autosuggest works like a combination of a Select and a Search input. Autosuggests are useful when there is a large but limited set of acceptable options, as well as for Natural Language Processing (NLP) inputs.

## When to use:

Use an Autosuggest when there is a large but limited set of acceptable responses, or to help guide the user to what they are looking for.

## When not to use:

- When there is no limit on potential responses; instead use a [Text Input](/components/detail/text-input)
