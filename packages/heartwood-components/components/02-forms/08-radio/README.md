# Radio
A Radio represent a single option in a set where only when option may be selected.

## When to use:
Use Radio inputs when the user must select only one option out of a set.

## When not to use:
- Many options; when there are many options, instead use an [Autosuggest](/components/detail/autosuggest)
- Multiple options; if a user may select more than one option in a set, use [Checkboxes](/components/detail/checkbox) instead.
