# Select
A Select allows the user to make a single selection from a short list of options.

## When to use:
Use a Select when a user must make a singular choice from a short list of possible choices.

## When not to use:
- Many options; if there are many options, instead use an [Autosuggest](/components/detail/autosuggest).
- Multiple selections; if a user can select multiple options, instead use [Checkboxes](/components/detail/checkbox), or TBD â€” some variation of [Autosuggest](/components/detail/autosuggest).
