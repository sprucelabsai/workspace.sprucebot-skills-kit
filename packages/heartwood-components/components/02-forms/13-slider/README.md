# Slider

A Slider allows a user to visually input a value that falls within a given range.

## Notes:

- The split-color execution is intended as a progressive enhancement. As such, the slider will only have a single color in older browsers that don’t support CSS variables.

## When to use:

Use a Slider when a value must fall within certain range to be acceptable.

## When not to use:

- No minimum and maximum; instead use a [Text Input](/components/detail/text-input) that only accepts numbers
- User preference; if it’s preferable for a user to type a value in, for example a decimal value that would be difficult to pinpoint on a Slider
