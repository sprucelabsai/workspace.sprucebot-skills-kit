# Loader

A Loader is an animated element that informs the user that something is happening behind the scenes.

## When to use:

Use a Loader while awaiting the result of an asynchronous action.

## When not to use:

- For simple, synchronous or fast actions; there is no need to use a loader if the result of an action seems immediately obvious to a user.
