# Primary Button

## When to use:
Use a Primary Button for the principle call to action, for example, to submit a form. If there are multiple actions that a user can take, only one of them should be expressed with a primary button.

## When not to use:
- For a destructive action; instead, use a [Caution Button](/components/detail/caution-button).
- Without clear hierarchy; if there is no principle call to action, use multiple [Secondary Buttons](/components/detail/secondary-button) or [Simple Buttons](/components/detail/simple-button).


## Uses these components
- [Loader](/components/detail/loader)
