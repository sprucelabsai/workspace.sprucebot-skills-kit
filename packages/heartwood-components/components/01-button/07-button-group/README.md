# Button Group

Button groups arrange related actions in close proximity. For example, a primary and secondary action.

## Segmented

A segmented Button Group may be used when several actions are closely related and there is no clear hierarchy among them.

## Floating

A floating Button Group may be used for a [Context Menu](/components/detail/context-menu) of related actions.
