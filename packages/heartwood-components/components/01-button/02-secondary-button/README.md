# Secondary Button

## When to use:
Use a Secondary Button for any action that is not the primary action, such as cancelling a form submission or exiting a task.

## When not to use:
- For a destructive action; instead, use a [Caution Button](/components/detail/caution-button).
- For the primary call to action; instead, use a [Primary Button](/components/detail/primary-button).
- In a visually cluttered context, it may be better to use a [Simple Button](/components/detail/simple-button).
