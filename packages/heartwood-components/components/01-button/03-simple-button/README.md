# Simple Button

When to use:
Simple buttons can be used in any context where an action may be triggered that is neither primary nor secondary. For example, a simple button with an ‘X’ icon can be used to close a modal.

When not to use:

- For a destructive action; instead, use a [Caution Button](/components/detail/caution-button).
- For the primary call to action; instead, use a [Primary Button](/components/detail/primary-button).

## Uses these components

- [Loader](/components/detail/loader)
