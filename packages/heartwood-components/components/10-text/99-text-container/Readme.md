# Text Container

The Text Container element provides vertical spacing to nested text-related components.

- The Text Container should be used to wrap any text elements including Heading, Subheading, and Text.
- The tight or loose spacing variants can be used to vary the vertical spacing of nested elements.
- The centered variation can be used to center all nested text and elements within the Text Container.
