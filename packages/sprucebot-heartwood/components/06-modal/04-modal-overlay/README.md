# Modal
Modals enable users to perform complex tasks without leaving the current view.

## Guidelines:
Context; a Modal should include enough information for a user to know what theyâ€™re doing at a glance
Accessibility; any Modal should be dismissible via the Esc key, and forms in Modals should behave just like any other form.

## When to use:
Use a Modal for tasks of medium complexity.

## When not to use:
- Simple tasks; if the task is very simple, avoid using a Modal
- High complexity; if the task is of high complexity, it may be preferable to push the user to a different view.
