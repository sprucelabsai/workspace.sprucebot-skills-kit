# Search
A Search input may be used to trigger a search based on user input.

## When to use:
Use the Search input to allow a userâ€™s search query to update the entire view.

## When not to use:
- To show search results in close proximity to the input or to capture input from a set group of options; instead use an [Autosuggest](/components/detail/autosuggest)
