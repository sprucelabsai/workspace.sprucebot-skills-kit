# Pagination
Pagination allows a user to navigate through a large amount of data.

## Guidelines:
- Only use the simple variation for very small and controlled sets of data
- Always show the current, first, and last pages
- When using the ‘Jump’ input, reset invalid input on blur

## When to use:
Use Pagination for large sets of data.

## When not to use:
- Small data sets; for small sets of data, pagination may be unnecessary
- Timelines; TBD — for data in a timeline instead use lazy loading
