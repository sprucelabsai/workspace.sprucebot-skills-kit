# ContextMenu

### ContextMenus bundle related actions that aren’t part of a user’s primary journey.

<Playground>
	<ContextMenu
		actions={[
			{
				text: 'Go to my dashboard'
			},
			{
				text: 'Notify my teammates'
			},
			{
				text: 'Log me out'
			}
		]}
		size="large"
	/>
</Playground>

## When to use

Only use a ContextMenu when there are multiple potential paths for a user that fall outside of their primary workflow.

## When not to use

Don’t hide primary or secondary actions in a ContextMenu. Instead, use a Button. If there is a clear primary action with closely related actions, use a SplitButton.

## Props

<Props of={ContextMenu} />
