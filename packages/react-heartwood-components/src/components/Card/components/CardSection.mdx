# CardSection

> CardSections are visually distinct containers that split up a Card.

<Playground>
	<CardSection>
		<p>
			Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, And
			that has made all the difference.

	</CardSection>
</Playground>

## When to use

Use a CardSection to break up information in a single Card into distinct sections.

## When not to use

Never use a CardSection outside of a Card or if the Card only has one section. Most cards shouldn’t require the use of CardSections.

## Props

<Props of={CardSection} />
