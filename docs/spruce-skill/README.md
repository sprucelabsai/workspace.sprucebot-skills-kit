# WTF?

This is a highly opinionated approach on how to rapidly build skills for Sprucebot. Ultimately, you could build a skill on any stack. 🤘🏼 This particular kit uses NodeJS + ReactJS with Next + Koa as supporting frameworks... May the force be with you.

## Technical requirements

- node v7.6+ : Koa requires node v7.6.0 or higher for ES2015 and async function support.
- Yarn is installed (you can use NPM if you really want)
